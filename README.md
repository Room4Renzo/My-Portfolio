# My-Portfolio
A personal portfolio made with HTML and CSS as a class project

## Features
I have made a personal/professional Portfolio containing different projects I worked on during my Front End Web Development Bootcamp with EdX
- Contains a personal short about me section and an avatar of me
- A prework study guide with notes on HTML, JavaScript, CSS and Git
- A Blackjack game played in the browser 
- A rock, paper, scissors game played through alerts in browser
- A refactored website that enhances accessibility
- I hope to replace each project as i gain more experience and create more applications/projects
 - I struggled with displaying the images correctly in the grid so i just edited them to the desired size in photoshop
